# JSWidget

JSWidget is a Widget for drawing Plotly plots offline in Jupyter.

This is just something I put together for one of my projects. I only tested what I used, i.e.

1. clear_plot()
2. new_plot()
3. add_traces()
4. delete_traces()

I couldn't get it to work reliably and efficiently in Firefox, so I moved to Chrome.

I tested this widget only with Python 3.5 and recent versions of Jupyter/IPython.

Have a look at `example.ipynb` to see how to use this widget. It should be very straightforward.
